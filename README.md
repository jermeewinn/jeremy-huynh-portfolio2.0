## Jeremy Huynh's Portfolio

My name is Jeremy, and I am a recent graduate of the UC Berkeley Full-Stack Development coding bootcamp. 

I am a graduate of UC Santa Cruz, class of 2018, with a BA degree in Politics, and a minor in History. Before getting into coding, I worked as a Sales Development Representative for 3 years for a number of different startups around the San Francisco Bay Area. With my background in Enterprise SaaS sales, I've become adept at working in teams and on developing a grindset work-ethic.
